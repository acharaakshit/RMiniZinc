# RMiniZinc

## Under Development

This package is aimed towards providing the r users to use MiniZinc from within R. Currently basic integer programming problems can be solved. The package vignette contains a basic demonstration of how to create a MiniZinc model for basic constraint programming problems and obtain a string output. The vignette will be updated from time to time and more features will be added to the package.

## Getting Started

One of the prerequisites to use this package is that [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) is installed on your system and has been added to the path. The installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.4.3/en/installation.html). You can verify if MiniZinc is accessible from the command line by typing `minizinc`. You can use the package once you have set up MiniZinc.
